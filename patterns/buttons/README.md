The buttons use our primary colour to draw attention and stand out. Each button has a specific purpose:

- The regular buttons are for cards, forms and where the background is a light colour.
- The light buttons are for dark background areas. These buttons can be used on banners with an image background.
- The ghost buttons should be used on simple and light-coloured backgrounds.
