      <div class="gutter push-0" id="q-1">
        <h5 class="questions">Why do you charge an adoption fee?</h5>
        <p class="pad-t-0">The sad reality is that we get the unwanted, unvetted, uncared for. We have had, and still have many adult dogs, most of whom came to us in need of medical care. Veterinary costs for the special cases can run into thousands of dollars. Some of the dogs have special needs like medications such as insulin for diabetes, Vetoryl for Cushings disease and heart medications for those that have heart issues in order to provide a better quality of life. Younger healthier dogs may not have quite the same health issues as the older dogs do but they too need to be examined, vaccinated and altered prior to adoption. They could also have problems like eye surgery, lump removals, diabetic. The adoption fee only partially covers these costs. Donations from the public are limited. LOYAL Rescue offsets the difference through fundraising efforts where we can.</p>

      <div class="gutter push-0" id="q-2">
        <h5 class="questions">What should I expect once I send in my application?</h5>
        <p class="pad-t-0">Stage 1 —Your application will undergo an initial review by a LOYAL volunteer and is assigned to a screener. Within a few days of sending in your application, a LOYAL volunteer will be in touch with you to set up a telephone interview. This interview lasts 30-60 minutes.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-0">Stage 2 —Your references, both veterinarian and personal, will be contacted. The volunteer will then submit a report to the LOYAL adoptions committee. Once the results of the interview are in, and positive, LOYAL will request that a home visit be done.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-0">Stage 3 — Depending on your location, the home visit may occur within days of the interview, or weeks later. If there are no LOYAL volunteers locally, we will request assistance from other rescue groups affiliated with us. Rescue work is largely volunteer based and many people have family obligations beyond rescue which might limit their immediate availability to conduct the visit.</p>
        <p class="pad-t-0">Approval and Adoption — Once the first 3 stages are complete and successful, the adoptions committee at LOYAL will notify you that you are "Approved to Adopt”.</p>

      <div class="gutter push-0" id="q-3">
        <h5 class="questions">Why do you ask for so much personal information? It would be much easier to go to the store and buy a puppy…</h5>
        <p class="pad-t-0">LOYAL believes that we have a duty to ensure that our dogs are placed in the homes best suited for them, with applicants that believe in the philosophy of rescue and have the patience to work through the screening process. The application provides some of the detail needed to make this determination. Certainly it is easier to walk into the store and buy a puppy because of the "instant gratification", but adopting a dog is a lifetime commitment, not something to take lightly. We go through this process to make sure that the fit is right, the dog is ready and you are the best home for them.</p>

      <div class="gutter push-0" id="q-4">
        <h5 class="questions">Can I donate to Loyal Rescue?</h5>
        <p class="pad-t-0">Yes! We are a nonprofit organization. We count on the support of others. If you would like to donate items please contact us HERE or make a monetary donation HERE. Your support is greatly appreciated.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="gutter push-0" id="q-5">
        <h5 class="questions">Can I foster a dog in my home?</h5>
        <p class="pad-t-0">If you have room in your heart and your home, you might consider fostering for us. At any given time, there are ~80 dogs in foster care. The need for foster homes is so great that we have no choice but to turn away requests for help from shelters and from the public. If you would like to become a foster home, please go to our contacts tab and complete the form.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="gutter push-0" id="q-6">
        <h5 class="questions">How else can I help?</h5>
        <p class="pad-t-0">If you have room in your heart but not in your home, consider giving your time to help us in other ways. We always need drivers to help with the transporting of dogs across the province (primarily the Windsor/Montreal/Ottawa corridor. We need help with outreach at adoption events. We need administrative help to run the day to day operations. There are many roles to be filled in rescue and we need your help to be able to help more dogs. Please go to our contacts tab and complete the form if you are interested in helping out.</p>

      <div class="gutter push-0" id="q-7">
        <h5 class="questions">I live in Ottawa and want a dog that's being fostered in Toronto, do I have to pick up the in Toronto or do you deliver?</h5>
        <p class="pad-t-0">If you are the successful applicant, you need to make arrangements to come meet and pick up your new family member personally. This also applies for out of province adoptions. We absolutely will not ship these rescued dogs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="gutter push-0" id="q-8">
        <h5 class="questions">I'm interested in a puppy — how big will Rex be when he's full grown?</h5>
        <p class="pad-t-0">Most of the pups that come into rescue, or are born while in rescue, come from an unknown background. We can't tell you what dad was - breed or size - because we don't know ourselves. Based on mom and our best guess, we can try to estimate, but please understand that it's only a guess.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="gutter push-0" id="q-9">
        <h5 class="questions">My current pet is not spayed or neutered — is that a problem?</h5>
        <p class="pad-t-0">LOYAL Rescue's policy concerning all cats and dogs, regardless of whether they are indoor or not, is they should be altered unless a medical condition prevents it, or the animal is "champion" stock and intentionally is kept intact with the intention of improving the bloodlines. We will not consider a home with an unaltered dog or cat unless there is a valid reason for this not being done.</p>
